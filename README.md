# Clicktag pipeline 


Example usage:
```bash
Rscript ct_pipeline.R sample_config.yaml
```


# TODOs:


CT stats: 
- [ ] total number of input droplets  
- [ ] explain the doublet rates   
- [ ] explain the plots   

Doublets:  
- [ ] Add doublet rates between the batches - i.e. doublet labeling 

Misc:  
- [ ] `num_ct` should be guessed from the barcode file   

# how to do this properly????
